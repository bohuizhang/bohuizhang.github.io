    - title: Knowledge Graphs Enrichment Model
      institution: <b>Student Researcher</b> @ Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California

        - Investigated the feasibility of enriching Wikidata with structured data sources from the linked open data (LOD) cloud.
        - "Proposed a method that consists of several steps: gap detection, external graph selection, schema alignment, knowledge retrieval, and validation, implemented the procedure using the Knowledge Graph Toolkit (KGTK)."
        - "Evaluated the method on enriching Wikidata with two LOD sources: DBpedia and Getty Vocabularies. The experiments showed that the LOD-based method can enrich Wikidata with millions of new high-quality statements efficiently."

        - Worked on a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) system for optimizing models in search space defined by ProxylessNAS, used on image classification and feature extraction tasks based on dataset collecting from group's retail sector.
        - Improved the model training process using knowledge distillation and improved the optimal model architecture searching process in various hardware environments using policy gradient algorithm based on target accuracy, FLOPs and latency.
        - The optimal models deployed on terminal machines achieved model compression for more than 60% decrease on FLOPs while improving rank1 and rank6 compared with state-of-the-art MobileNetV2 models and keeping the top1 accuracy above 98%.
