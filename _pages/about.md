Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Bohui Zhang, a PhD student in the Department of Informatics at King's College London supervised by Prof. [Elena Simperl](http://elenasimperl.eu/) and Dr. [Albert MeroÃ±o PeÃ±uela](https://www.albertmeronyo.org/). My research interests are:

* Trustworthy knowledge engineering
* Natural language processing in knowledge graph construction, especially the usage of prompt engineering and large language models
* Explainable AI in knowledge graphs

Prior to King's, I received my master's degree in Applied Data Science at University of Southern California (USC) in 2021. In USC, I worked on Wikidata enrichment and Linked Open Data with Dr. [Filip Ilievski](http://www.ilievski.info/) at [CKG @ ISI](https://www.isi.edu/centers-ckg/). I had an internship working on neural architecture search at Alibaba Cloud in Summer 2021. 

If you're interested in collaborating with me, don't hesitate to reach out at `bhzhang97@gmail.com`. ðŸ˜ƒ
